\chapter{Problem definition}\label{ch:problem-definition}

The problem with implementation of optimization algorithms in applications is that their
performance requirements are quite high and are fully utilized only while working.
Optimization algorithm is not running all the time and for that reason hardware resources are mainly unused.
These unused resources could be potentially used by another instance of algorithm
or can be shutdown completely to reduce hosting costs.

Also adding more time to job execution does not always bring better solution
but it certainly costs more.
Therefore proposed load balancer must be able to stop execution when solution value
is not getting better in comparison with scheduling costs.

\noindent Unfortunately, \todo{add more reasons why not to use this particular definition}
this definition seems to be a bit confusing and it later in the paper it led to problems while defining system's behavior.

And thus I present simplified definition - another approach to the problem.
