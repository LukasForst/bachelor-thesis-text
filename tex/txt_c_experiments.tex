\chapter{Experiments}\label{ch:experiments}

To test the application,
there are two modules, 
that contain simulation codes used for testing -
\inlinecode{simulation} and \inlinecode{remote-scheduler} modules.
Simulation engine and all simulation use cases are located in simulation module.
The second mentioned module contains server, 
which runs simulations on remote API. 
This is especially useful when testing whole scheduling environment for example in Docker Compose network
and it is as closest as possible to real life environment,
which should be running in micro services architecture.
