\chapter{Experiments}\label{ch:experiments}

In this chapter, 
we would like to present,
how we tested the load balancer.
The simulations were designed to reflect the real-life situations 
and to simulate the most common usage of the load balancer.


\section{Simulations implementation}\label{sec:simulations-implementations}
To test the load balancer,
there are two modules, 
that contain simulation code used for testing -
\inlinecode{simulation} and \inlinecode{remote-scheduler} module.
The simulation engine and all simulation use cases are located in the simulation module.
The second mentioned module contains server, 
which runs simulations on the remote API. 
This is especially useful when testing whole scheduling environment
and it is as closest as possible to the real-life environment,
which should be based on the microservices architecture.
