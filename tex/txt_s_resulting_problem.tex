\section{Resulting problem}\label{sec:resulting-problem}
Taken together,
optimization algorithms load balancing problem results in computational task scheduling optimization problem.
Proposed formal definition (\ref{sec:formal-definition}) implies that problem is in fact, 
integer linear problem with job execution cost as its main optimization criteria. 
These kind of problems are solvable by various types of linear programming solvers.
Linear optimization and its characteristics are outlined in previous section \ref{subsec:linear-optimization}.

However,
apart from load balancing decisions,
the problem brings another challenges in time series prediction during the job executions.
In the following chapter \ref{ch:solution-design},
I would like to describe how I managed to solve the main optimization problem
and related time series prediction.
