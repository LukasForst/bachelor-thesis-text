\section{Resulting problem}\label{sec:resulting-problem}
Proposed formal definition (\ref{sec:formal-definition}) implies that problem is 
integer linear problem with job execution cost as its main optimization criteria. 
These problems are solvable by various types of mixed integer linear programming solvers.
Linear optimization and its characteristics are outlined in previous section \ref{subsec:linear-optimization}.

However,
apart from load balancing decisions,
the problem brings another challenge in time series prediction during the job executions.
This problem arises because algorithm, by definition presented in section \ref{sec:formal-definition},
estimates enhancement of the job's solution value when the job uses particular resources in the next period.
In other words, 
the algorithm needs to estimate the impact of using particular resources in the next period on solution value function development.
Therefore in time $t$ it needs to estimate value of the solution value function $v_{t+1}^{j}$.
The definition in section \ref{sec:formal-definition} describes it as $^{r}\Delta_{t}^{j}$ variable.
Based on the $^{r}\Delta_{t}^{j}$ value, the reward for improving solution value $S_{t}^{j}$ is computed.
This reward is then used when the load balancing decisions are being made to reflect the suitability of the current execution plan solution.
