\section{Optimization algorithms data}\label{sec:optimization-algorithms-data}
For the proper testing environment,
the real runtime data of some optimization algorithm were needed.
I decided to use TASP (mentioned in subsection \ref{subsubsec:tasp}) as an example heuristic algorithm
which execution could be potentially scheduled by the instance of optimization load balancer.
I did not implement new TASP instance,
instead I used instances from Stochastic Dynamic Vehicle Routing Problem master's thesis by Petr Eichler\cite{Eichler:Petr:2003}.

These instances solve real life vehicle routing problem 
and mainly for that reason are ideal for testing purposes.
I slightly modified the code from thesis for observation purposes
and added time measuring functionality,
which tracked time between the algorithm's iterations and the current job value in each iteration.
 

% The structured data can be found in \inlinedata{jobs-data/input} folder in the project.
