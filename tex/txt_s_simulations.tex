\section{Simulations}\label{sec:simulations}

There are two main randomized simulation scenarios inside simulation module 
(module described in \ref{subsec:simulations-architecture}).
Both simulation can be started up locally or
using \inlinecode{docker-compose} microservices runtime environment.

First simulation is designed to use only first scheduling stage described in section \ref{sec:olb-algorithm}
and create static initial plan which is then not modified.
This simulation is implemented in \inlinecode{OnePlanningRoundMain} class
and can be easily modified.
Input data for this test are created randomly,
based on number of scheduled jobs and given planning horizon (how much steps ahead should scheduler count with).
