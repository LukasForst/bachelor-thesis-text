\section{Formal definition}\label{sec:formal-definition}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $T_{\max}$ - maximal optimization job execution time provided by user and specified before execution started

    \item $T$ - actual optimization job execution time, when no execution time optimization is being used $T = T_{\max}$

    \item $RC$ - \textit{Resource Costs} - all hardware costs used for executing optimization job by some algorithm
    \todo{don't know how to say that - costs that you actually pay for hardware}
    \begin{equation}
        RC = \sum_{i=0}^T RC_i
    \end{equation}

    \item $RC_t$ - \textit{Resource Costs} in time $t$ - accumulated costs from beginning of execution to time $t$
    \begin{equation}
        RC_{t} = \sum_{i=0}^{t-1} RC_i
    \end{equation}

    \item $RC_{\max}$ - maximal resource costs specified by user in advance
    \begin{equation}
        RC_{\max} \geq RC
    \end{equation}

    \item $V$ - \textit{Solution Value} - value of the found solution, since this paper focus on cost optimization,
    \textit{Solution Value} is cost of found solution
    \begin{equation}
        V = min \{ V_t \}, \quad t = 0 \dots T
    \end{equation}

    \item $V_t$ - \textit{Solution Value} in time $t$ - best solution provided by algorithm since the beginning of the job execution
    until time $t$

\end{itemize}

Then load balancer optimizes following function

\begin{equation}
    min \{ \alpha RC + \beta V \,|\, \alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{R} \}
\end{equation}

Where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are coefficients that are balancing $RC$ and $V$.



%TODO define load balancer requirements
%\subsection{Load Balancer Requirements}\label{subsec:load-balancer-requirements}
% For successful server implementation we must enforce following things
% \begin{itemize}
%    \item Running optimization algorithms can't interfere with each other
%    \item RMS guarantee that scheduled job will be always executed
%    \item
% \end{itemize}
