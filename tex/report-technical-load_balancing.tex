\section{Load Balancing}\label{sec:load-balancing}
There will be some info about how should server balance itself.
\begin{itemize}
    \item prioritisation - mainly done by priority queues
    \item handover
    \item instance sizing
    \item algorithms - following are methods used in network balancing -> probably can't be used because we need to manage scheduling
    which is heavy on computer resources like CPU/RAM/IO
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The Least Connection Method
        \item The Round Robin Method
        \item The Least Response Time Method
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
