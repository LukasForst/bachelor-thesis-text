\section{Choosing the algorithm}\label{sec:choosing-the-algorithm}

This work does not contain any own algorithm implementation for scheduling problems,
instead I would like to use pre-prepared and already implemented solver. \\
We have many options, how to represent and then solve scheduling problem such as
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Linear programming - more specifically mixed integer programming
    \item Heuristics algorithms
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Linear Programming}\label{subsec:linear-programming}
