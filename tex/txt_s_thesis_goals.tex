\section{Thesis goals}\label{sec:thesis-goals}

This thesis extensively studies and describes state of the art algorithms used for computational task scheduling
and load balancing in section \ref{sec:load-balancing}. 
It also brings overview of various optimization problems, techniques and algorithms 
that are being used in real-life situations to solve diverse industries problems 
in section \ref{sec:optimization-algorithms}.
The complex problem of computational task scheduling is formalized in chapter \ref{ch:problem-formalization}.

Although the main goal is to develop fully functional scheduling system,
mainly because of estimated complexity,
this thesis focuses only on system's core - 
scheduling and load balancing for optimization algorithms in heterogenous distributed environment.

Solution design including final algorithm is proposed in chapter \ref{ch:solution-design}.
In the following chapter (\ref{ch:implementation}),
thesis describes resulting implementation of the load balancing system
and also gives overview of its architecture in the section \ref{sec:architecture}.
Scheduler is then evaluated using multiple simulations in section \ref{sec:simulations}.

To achieve ultimate goal, having fully functional scheduling and load balancing system,
future necessary steps are outlined in section \ref{sec:future-work}.
