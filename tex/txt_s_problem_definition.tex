\section{Problem definition}\label{sec:problem-definition}

The problem with implementation of optimization algorithms in applications is that their
performance requirements are quite high and are fully utilized only while working.
Optimization algorithm is not running all the time and for that reason hardware resources are mainly unused.
These unused resources could be potentially used by another instance of algorithm
or can be shutdown completely tp reduce hosting costs.

\subsection{Formal definition}\label{subsec:what-i-want}
Load balancer take in account following scheduling job properties.



\subsection{Load Balancer Requirements}\label{subsec:load-balancer-requirements}
%TODO
%For successful server implementation we must enforce following things
%\begin{itemize}
%    \item Running optimization algorithms can't interfere with each other
%    \item RMS guarantee that scheduled job will be always executed
%    \item
%\end{itemize}
