\chapter{Implementation}\label{ch:implementation}
In this chapter I would like to present the technologies that were used while implementing the previously described system.
During the development,
base package of the application was named \inlinecode{OLB},
which is an acronym for \textbf{O}ptimization \textbf{L}oad \textbf{B}alancer.
In the following pages, 
the developed application is called this way.

To achieve production ready load balancing system, 
an execution module, which would execute load balancing decisions made by the implemented core and physically move jobs between resources,
is needed.
However,
the implementation of this module is out of scope of this thesis.
Therefore it is outlined, along with other future work, in section \ref{sec:future-work}.
