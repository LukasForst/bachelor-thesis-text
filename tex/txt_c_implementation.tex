\chapter{Implementation}\label{ch:used-technologies}
In this chapter I would like to present the technologies that were used while implementing the previously described system.
During the development,
base package of the application was named \inlinecode{OLB},
which is an acronym for \textbf{O}ptimization \textbf{L}oad \textbf{B}alancer.
In the following pages, 
the developed application is called this way.
