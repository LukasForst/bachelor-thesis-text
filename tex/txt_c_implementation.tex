\chapter{Implementation}\label{ch:used-technologies}
In this chapter I would like to present the technologies that were used while implementing the previously described system.
During the development,
base package of the application was named \inlinecode{OLB},
which is an acronym for \textbf{O}ptimization \textbf{L}oad \textbf{B}alancer.
In the following pages, 
the developed application is called this way.

The implementation itself was focused mainly on load balancing algorithm 
and on core of the system.
What is not part of this paper,
and belongs to future work (described in section \ref{sec:future-work}),
is an execution module, 
which would be able to perform the decisions made by the core algorithm presented 
and implemented in this thesis.
