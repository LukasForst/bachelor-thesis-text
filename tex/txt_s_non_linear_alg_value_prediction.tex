\section{Algorithms values prediction}\label{sec:impl-algorithms-values-predictions}
The implementation of Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm is not the aim of this paper,
for that reason the application uses Java compatible library, 
which contains implementation Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm 
and provides way, 
how to use it.

OLB uses two different libraries Apache Commons Mathematics Library\cite{web:apacheCommonsMath}
and Mathematical Finance Library\cite{web:finmathLib}.
The both libraries have custom wrapper which implements \inlinecode{HyperbolicRegression} abstract class 
and they can be exchanged in the application when decided.
The reason, there are two different implementations and two different libraries,
is that their performance can differ in distinguish scenarios.
By default, the Mathematical Finance Library is used, 
because it provides better results in runtime predictions\footnote{
    There is a Python code, 
    which can provide graphs from values predictions, 
    please see \inlinecode{plot_predictions.py} 
    and \inlinecode{pw.forst.olb.simulation.prediction} package.
}.
The implementations can be found as \inlinecode{ApacheHyperbolicRegression} class for Apache Commons Mathematics Library
and \inlinecode{FinMathRegression} class for Mathematical Finance Library.
