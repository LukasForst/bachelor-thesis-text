\section{Optimization Algorithms}\label{sec:optimization-algorithms}

This work does not contain any own algorithm implementation for generic optimization problems,
instead I would like to use pre-prepared and already implemented optimization solver.
First we must specify which kind of approach we would like to choose.
We have many options, how to represent and then solve scheduling problem such as
\begin{itemize}
    \item Linear programming - mixed integers programming
    \item Constraint programming - heuristics algorithms
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Linear Programming}\label{subsec:linear-programming}
Some general information about linear programming goes here %TODO add here some info

\subsubsection{Advantages of linear programming approach}
%TODO

\subsubsection{Disadvantages of linear programming approach}
%TODO

\subsubsection{Existing solutions}\label{subsec:existing-solutions-lin}
GLPK
Google Optimization Kit

\subsection{Heuristic algorithms}\label{subsec:heuristic-algorithms}
General information about heuristic %TODO add heuristic

\subsubsection{Advantages of heuristic algorithms}
The main advantage of heuristic algorithms is that they offer a quick solution for problem they are solving.

\subsubsection{Disadvantages of heuristic algorithms}
The main downside of HA is the fact, that they can't guarantee that found solution is the optimal one.

\subsubsection{Existing solutions}\label{subsec:existing-solutions-heur}
I would like to mention two implementations of heuristics algorithms - OptaPlanner and TASP.

\subsubsection{OptaPlanner}
OptaPlanner is an open source generic heuristics based constraint solver.
It is optimized to
%TODO more fom https://www.optaplanner.org

\subsubsection{TASP}
\textit{Task and Asset Scheduling Platform}  is a lightweight framework developed by Blindspot Solutions designed to solve a large
variety of optimization and scheduling problems from the area of logistics, workforce management, manufacturing, planning and others.
It contains a modular, efficient planning engine utilizing latest optimization algorithms.
TASP is delivered as a software library to be used through its API in applications which require powerful scheduling capabilities.\\
It is written in Kotlin and runs on JVM.

\subsection{Selected algorithm}\label{subsec:selected-algorithm}
I decided to use one linear solver and one heuristic algorithm to test load balancing server.
This will provide us heterogeneous environment for distinguish optimization tasks as well as different demands on performance.\\
While choosing suitable solvers I was looking mainly at possibility running on JVM and their API as well as at their suitability for my paper.
For final testing I selected \textbf{GLPK} as linear solver, mainly because it is widely used linear programming kit
and because of it's convenient Java interface.\\
As a representative of heuristics algorithms I selected \textbf{TASP} because of it's great scalability, Kotlin interface
and because I have already worked with it and I'm familiar with multiple TASP implementations.
%TODO do I have to mention that I'm working for Blindspot?
